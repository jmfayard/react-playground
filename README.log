- hello world started by not working
    - Verify node and npm
    - homebrew has package "node" (v0.12) and node4-lts => using this one
    - npm install npm -g
    - hourra
- tried to break little things here and there, see how it's reported. Nice!
- Reading the README (!)
- npm installed the global packages needed (?) for eslint, no pb
- created intellij runner fron npm start and npm test
- vendor prefixes automatically added. Ouch would have been such a pain
- With webpack, you can import './Button.js' and images!
